## Read/Write throughput:
- L1 Cache	~1000–2000 GB/s	= 1000× faster
- L2 Cache	~500–1000 GB/s	= 500× faster
- L3 Cache	~100–400 GB/s	= 100× faster
- RAM (DDR4)	20–25 GB/s	= 10× faster (double data transfer)  
- NVMe SSD	2–3 GB/s	baseline (Non-volatile memory express)
- SATA SSD	0.5 GB/s = 0.6x slower

## Cache usages
L1 - Fastest, smallest, immediate data  
L2 - Fast, medium, data needed soon  
L3 - Moderate ,largest ,reduce RAM usage  

RAM DDR - double data rate -> RAM can transfer data two times per clock cycle - Once on the rising edge of the clock signal, once on the falling edge  

ATA - advanced technology attachment 
used to connect storage devices to motherboard  
PATA - parallel ATA - wide ribbon cables - very slow 
SATA - serial ATA - thin small cable used to connect SSD HDD - faster than PATA  
SATA SSD uses SATA cable  
NVMe - faster than SATA SSD as it does not use SATA port, it uses PCIe bus which is faster
