## Richter Scale graph
- During an earthquake, seismic waves are created  
- using seismograph, they measured the hight of these seismic waves
- Noticed that earthquake amplitude grows in powers of 10
- So to reduce the exponential growth, logarithmic function is used (log base 10)
- Magnitude - log(wave height)
- So, richter scale came about and was decided from 1 to 9
- Exponential function is used to expand small numbers, therefore that function is not desirable here

## Comparing Laptop Specifications   
## Macbook Air M3  
- Apple’s latest processor - CPU + GPU + Neural Engine
- 8-core CPU
- 4 performance cores -> handle heavy tasks (coding, editing, gaming).
- 4 efficiency cores -> handle light tasks (browsing, notes) while saving battery.
- 10-core GPU -> This handles graphics: animations, video editing, games
- 16-core Neural Engine -> This accelerates:AI tasks,face recognition
- 100GB/s memory bandwidth -> This means your RAM can move data extremely fast between CPU, GPU, and memory.
- 15.3-inch IPS screen
- IPS = color-accurate display with good viewing angles.
- 2880 × 1864 resolution - sharp display
- RAM: 16GB for heavy multitasking, video editing, running many apps at once
- Apple uses unified memory, which is faster than traditional RAM -> CPU + GPU + Neural Engine share the SAME memory pool, No copying, no delay.
- Battery:66.5-watt-hour battery -> Large battery for a laptop of this size.
- Storage: (SSD) 512 GB

## Lenovo Thinkpad T480
- Intel i5 core CPU (4 cores)
- Intel R UHD 620 - GPU (lower processing)
- RAM: 8GB
- SSD: 256 GB
- Battery: 10.27 Watt-Hour battery (old battery)
- Display: 1920x1080 

## Comparing m2 and m3 processor:
- It uses more advanced 3nm process technology
- has 25 billion transistors compared to the M2's 20 billion
- and a faster CPU clock speed of 4.05 GHz, m2-> 3.49 GHz
